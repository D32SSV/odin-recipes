        <h3>Description(What is Lachha Paratha?)</h3>
        <p>These layered flatbreads are named after the buttery, 
            flaky layers that appear when you cook this paratha. 
            Thanks to all those beautiful layers, 
            these parathas can look a little complicated to make, 
            but that is actually far from the truth.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Ghee</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps to follow</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add whole wheat flour and salt to a bowl. 
                Make a small well in the middle and add 1 teaspoon of ghee. 
                Mix this using your fingers till the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Add lukewarm water little by little and knead into a soft, supple dough.
                Add upto one tablespoon of extra water, if necessary. 
                Form into a ball and rest for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take a golf ball-sized piece of dough and roll it out into a thin circle. 
                The thinner the better. Brush all over with a teaspoon of melted ghee and 
                sprinkle a thin layer of dry atta or whole wheat flour all over the ghee.</li>
            <li>Start pleating it from one side, making thin pleats as you go. Stretch this
                pleated dough to lengthen it and then roll it up into a ball. Dust it with 
                flour and roll it out into a 5 inch circle to make lachha parathas. 
                Repeat this with the remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Heat a tawa till evenly hot. Place the paratha and cook it for 2-3 minutes.
                Once you start seeing bubbles form, flip it. Cook it on a low flame for 2-3 minutes
                on the other side.</li>
            <li>Using tongs, place the semi cooked paratha directly on the flame and cook it on the
                open fire while flipping it every few seconds to ensure it's evenly cooked.</li>
            <li>Once the paratha is crispy and golden brown, smear it with ghee or butter. 
                Crumple it with your hands to reveal the layers. Serve hot.</li>
